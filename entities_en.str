// Hero_Magmar
Hero_Magmar_name												Magmus
Hero_Magmar_description											The primordial and elemental creature known as Magmus is no demon, though he fights alongside the Hellbourne.  Rather, he was drawn forth from the earth, as evil calls to evil and separate flames join to form an inferno.  A holdover from an ancient, cataclysmic age of fire, Magmus dreams of returning Newerth to ash, lava, and cinder, and he wields his considerable might and magic in that terrible cause.
Hero_Magmar_role												Magmus is capable of dealing huge amounts of magic damage in a large area-of-effect with Lava Surge and Eruption. However, because Eruption is channeled, a Portal Key is required to make the most out of the ability.

Hero_Maliken_description										Once the greatest defender of mankind and lord over the entire Legion, Maliken walked too close to the darkness and was claimed by it.  Now he is nothing more than a slave among the damned -- but his incredible might has only grown in his downfall.  Wielding a damned sword fed by his own damned soul, Maliken is the bane of the very heroes he once led into battle.

Because Hellbourne Zeal makes Maliken attack faster as he loses health, playing Maliken requires the player to carefully manage his survival. A Shrunken Head will increase his survivability greatly.

Hero_Martyr_description											Few clergy of Sol burn with such brilliance that they may ascend to the highest orders of priesthood. Even fewer dare gift their own souls to the Legion, braving an eternity in damnation so that others may prosper in turn. The few who do earn the forsaken title of the Martyr, wielding a battle-ready relic in one hand and carrying the Codex Solaris in the other. To certain death they march; and some say, with more fervor than those who march towards life.

Knowing exactly how much enemies can deal and what you can take and dish out at all times is key to playing a successful Martyr. Unlike some supports, Martyr scales well with tank items, and can be a big threat if left unchecked. A combination of healing, health swing, and protective skills makes Martyr a versatile and dangerous support.

A wise and knowledgeable researcher, he had devoted his life's work to perfecting the ancient art of alchemy.
