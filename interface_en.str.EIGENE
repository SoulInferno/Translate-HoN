loading_tiptitle				Game Hint
loading_tip1					Holding ^gCONTROL^* while using the shop will display recipe scrolls instead of the item, allowing you to quickly purchase the recipe.
loading_tip2					While using an ability, you can hold ^gSHIFT^* and select another ability to put it in your ability queue. As soon as the first ability has completed the next ability will fire immediately after.
loading_tip3					You can attack your own creeps when they are low health. If you kill them it results in a "deny" and surrounding enemies get much less experience than they would normally.
loading_tip4					If you attack your tower when it is low and destroy it, the enemy team gets much less gold than if they had destroyed it themselves.
loading_tip5					Typing /matchup or /ma in game will print a list of all the players, heroes, levels, and player colors.
loading_tip6					You can sell an item from your stash by holding ^gSHIFT^* and ^gCONTROL^* when ^gRIGHT ^gCLICKING^* an item.
loading_tip7					You can quickly transfer an item between your stash and inventory by holding ^gCONTROL^* and ^gRIGHT ^gCLICKING^* the item.
loading_tip8					Lost track of where your hero is? Tapping the ^gC^* key will center the screen on your hero.
loading_tip9					Magic Armor reduces the damage you take from Magic damage, which includes many spells and abilities.
loading_tip10					Try to always have at least one Homecoming Stone. You never know when you'll need to help defend the other side of the map or use it to avoid being ganked.
loading_tip11					Holding ground (^gH^* by default) will stop your hero from attacking or moving, allowing you to time last hits with more precision.
loading_tip12					You can quickly share control of a courier with other players by clicking the small arrows above their pictures on the left side of the screen.
loading_tip13					Wards of Sight are an inexpensive way to gain a large advantage over opponents by watching where they go and who they are with.
loading_tip14					In the beginning of the game, never leave the base without a way to heal yourself.
loading_tip15					Kongor respawns 7 minutes after he is killed and reclaims the Token of Life if it has not been used.
loading_tip16					Kongor drops the Token of Life when killed. The Token resurrects the holder instantly when they die, but is consumed in the process.
loading_tip17					Fear the Chiprel!
loading_tip18					A special powerup spawns every two minutes in the river and can grant you movement speed, invisibility, regeneration, double damage, or illusions.
loading_tip19					Neutral creeps respawn every minute as long as nothing is nearby. 
loading_tip20					You can sell back an item for a full refund as long as it is within 15 seconds of when you bought it.
loading_tip21					Killing the entire enemy team is called a Genocide.
loading_tip22					At the beginning of the game you cannot take many hits before dying, so make sure to stay behind your creeps and not take much damage.
loading_tip23					When the opposing team has heroes with invisibility, use Dust of Revelation, Wards of Revelation, or a Bound Eye to reveal them.
loading_tip24					Recipes are not useful on their own, you need all of the components before they will do anything for you.
loading_tip25					In the early game, if an enemy hero in your lane goes missing suddenly, be sure to let your team know. It can prevent them from being unexpectedly killed.
loading_tip26					Teamwork is essential to win. If you find yourself getting killed a lot while alone, stick with some allies. 
loading_tip27					Watch the Minimap. It is a great tool for keeping an eye on your enemies position. Be careful for missing enemy heroes or allies coming to help you kill in your lane.
loading_tip28					Communication is important. Talk to your team, call for help, and listen to other players when they call a hero missing. 
loading_tip29					To ping the minimap and alert your team, hold ^gALT^* and click an area! 
loading_tip30					There is more than one way to play a hero. Try picking different items you might not normally use.
loading_tip31					Couriers cannot be used to fill up bottles from the fountain.
loading_tip32					Attacking enemy heroes when they are focusing on your teammate (and therefore ignoring you) can often turn a bad situation around. Use the opponents distraction to your advantage.
loading_tip33					There are lots of places you can enter the trees to hide or take shortcuts. Learning where these are will greatly increase your survival chances.
loading_tip34					When you read "Superior Magic" in a skill description, it means the skill will affect the target, even if it is magic immune.
loading_tip35					Look to see what skills are on cooldown from your team by highlighting their portraits top left.
loading_tip36					Your team will appreciate you more if you use high damage nukes early in fights rather than as finishers.
loading_tip37					You can see the gold, skills, health, and mana, of your allies at the top left of your screen. If you select their hero, you can see their items.
loading_tip38					Do not be afraid to lose. Good judgment comes from experience, and experience comes from bad judgment. Everyone was new at one point.
loading_tip39					Be nice! A player will often ignore advice if you are screaming at them. Try saying it in a polite tone as a suggestion more than an order.
loading_tip40					Typing /gameinfo or /gi in game will print a list of the current game options.
loading_tip41					Clicking on this hint box will display a new hint.
loading_tip42					Selecting a ^!yRegion^* and enabling the "Filter Pre-Query" checkbox on game browser interface will allow you to browse and refresh games faster.
loading_tip43					When a notification pops up in game, you can ^gRIGHT ^gCLICK^* anywhere on it to close it rather than clicking the 'X' button.
loading_tip44					You can turn specific notifications on or off, or disable notifications in game by clicking "Options" and then navigating to the "Interface" tab.
loading_tip45					Each team can only pause up to 3 times per game. Use them wisely!

rap_3_title							Feeding
rap_3_tiptitle						What is Feeding?
rap_3_tiptxt						Intentionally dying.
rap_3_longtxt						Players who play poorly and repeatedly die do not fall under this category, only those who have the intent to feed the opposing team. In most cases you will need written proof that the player is intentionally feeding.
rap_4_title							AFK Abuse
rap_4_tiptitle						What is Avoiding AFK Detection?
rap_4_tiptxt						Moving around to avoid being detected as AFK while not participating.
rap_4_longtxt						In this instance, the player will usually stay in the base, refusing to help, and only move when they are in danger of being marked AFK and getting kicked. If the player simply goes AFK and can be kicked, they are not avoiding AFK detection. 
rap_5_title							Ability/Item Abuse
rap_5_tiptitle						What is Ability/Item Abuse?

rap_7_tiptxt						Destroying one's items out of spite.

rap_8_tiptitle						What is Backdooring?
rap_8_tiptxt						Attacking a tower without any creeps by it.
rap_8_longtxt						Backdooring is not against the code of conduct and is not a reportable action. It is a viable strategy and can be easily countered with a homecoming stone.

rap_9_tiptitle						What is Leaving The Game?
rap_9_tiptxt						Leaving in the middle of games, also known as "Rage Quitting".

rap_10_tiptitle						What is Playing Poorly?
rap_10_tiptxt						Not warding, dying a lot, and using skills ineffectively.

rap_nonevent_btn					Complete Incident Report
rap_nonevent_example				The following is an example of an invalid report:

rap_3_nonevent_title				You have opted to file a report for Intentional Feeding
rap_3_nonevent_deposit				Please note that the following are examples of ^ynon-reportable instances^* of Intentional Feeding. If you report any of these actions, your case will be closed and your ^ydeposit will be lost^*.
rap_3_nonevent_li_1					Player was playing poorly due to a lack of skill
rap_3_nonevent_li_2					Player died early game unintentionally
rap_3_nonevent_li_3					Player claims he is going to feed but never does
rap_3_nonevent_li_4					Player is under leveled and dies easily
rap_3_nonevent_li_5					Player has disconnected but players feed the disconnected hero
rap_3_nonevent_detail				If a player is intentionally feeding it will be apparent in their behavior, usually by running down the lane to the enemies to die, over and over again. Players will often announce they are going to feed, however this isn't always the case. If a player begins to feed they will usually do it multiple times to ensure defeat. 
rap_3_nonevent_example				Player "1337honn3r" reports: "Offender went 2/6 mid and made us lose the game." This report was marked innocent because the offender did not intentionally feed. Although they may have failed during the lane-phase the offender was simply playing poorly.


rap_4_nonevent_title				You have opted to file a report for AFK Detection Abuse
rap_4_nonevent_deposit				Please note that the following are examples of ^ynon-reportable instances^* of AFK Detection Abuse. If you report any of these actions, your case will be closed and your ^ydeposit will be lost^*.
rap_4_nonevent_li_1					Player was kicked though and AFK vote
rap_4_nonevent_li_2					Player was marked AFK and was never kicked
rap_4_nonevent_li_3					Player went legitimately AFK, and game ended before player could be kicked
rap_4_nonevent_li_4					Player disconnected and never reconnected
rap_4_nonevent_li_5					You didn't like them
rap_4_nonevent_detail				AFK Detection is designed to allow allied players to remove an offender who has decided to quit playing the game. When kicked, this provides the remaining team members with a gold bonus and items, allowing them to better continue their game.
rap_4_nonevent_example				Player "1337honn3r" reports: "Offender went to the pool at level 4 and stayed there until the end of the game." This report was marked innocent because the offender sat in the well and did not move or cast spells. An AFK flag was raised, but he was never kicked.

rap_5_nonevent_title				You have opted to file a report for Ability/Item Abuse
rap_5_nonevent_deposit				Please note that the following are examples of ^ynon-reportable instances^* of Ability/Item Abuse. If you report any of these actions, your case will be closed and your ^ydeposit will be lost^*.
rap_5_nonevent_li_1					Player uses spells and abilities in attempt to save you from death
rap_5_nonevent_li_2					Player accidentally misses/targets an ability that affects you
rap_5_nonevent_li_3					Player chooses not to heal or use spells that may benefit you
rap_5_nonevent_detail				Ability and/or Item Abuse occurs when players attempt to disrupt teammates by using specific items or abilities. "No-Help" can be toggled by clicking the green circle next to their hero portrait, but is still a reportable offense if used to effect the outcome of the game.
rap_5_nonevent_example				Player "1337honn3r" reports: "While trying to escape, my ally used a tablet of command on me, and I accidentally got stuck in trees." This report was deemed innocent because the reported player was attempting to use his item for its intended purpose.

rap_6_nonevent_title				You have opted to file a report for Item/Courier Spamming
rap_6_nonevent_deposit				Please note that the following are examples of ^ynon-reportable instances^* of Item/Courier Spamming. If you report any of these actions, your case will be closed and your ^ydeposit will be lost^*.
rap_6_nonevent_li_1					Player purchases their own courier
rap_6_nonevent_li_2					Player buys all the wards, but places them appropriately
rap_6_nonevent_li_3					Player purchases items that may not be beneficial, but can't be lost when dropped
rap_6_nonevent_detail				If a player is mass purchasing items and/or couriers, they often hinder the team. Such examples of this include, but are not limited to: purchasing all the wards and placing them in base, buying a Bound Eye then sacrificing it to the other team, or buying multiple couriers and sending them to die.
rap_6_nonevent_example				Player "1337honn3r" reports: "Our ally bought wards but placed it so it couldn't see the rune spawn." This report was deemed innocent because the wards were placed to give vision of enemy heroes, despite the lack of knowledge the player had of warding spots.

rap_7_nonevent_title				You have opted to file a report for Item Destruction
rap_7_nonevent_deposit				Please note that the following are examples of ^ynon-reportable instances^* of Item Destruction. If you report any of these actions, your case will be closed and your ^ydeposit will be lost^*.
rap_7_nonevent_li_1					Courier dies while delivering items to a player
rap_7_nonevent_li_2					Player destroys items that cannot be sold, such as a Logger's Hatchet
rap_7_nonevent_li_3					Enemies destroying allied items that have been placed on the ground or falling from a courier
rap_7_nonevent_li_4					Destroying runes despite players being nearby
rap_7_nonevent_detail				Item Destruction can be reported when a player (and more often an ally) destroys items that could benefit you or the team. A common example is a player that destroys their own items before disconnecting, in order to leave the allied teammembers without any sort of compensation.
rap_7_nonevent_example				Player "1337honn3r" reports: "I was at the secret shop buying a Ward, but had to drop my Codex on the ground to do that. This enemy Night Hound attacked and destroyed my Codex." This report was deemed innocent because the reporter is at fault for dropping their item out in the open. If conditions are unsafe, it may be best to wait until you are back at base.

rap_1_nonevent_title				You have opted to file a report for Verbal Abuse
rap_1_nonevent_deposit				Please note that the following are examples of ^ynon-reportable instances^* of Verbal Abuse. If you report any of these actions, your case will be closed and your ^ydeposit will be lost^*.
rap_1_nonevent_li_1					You and the offender both insult each other
rap_1_nonevent_li_2					Player uses a few insults about you playing poorly
rap_1_nonevent_detail				If a player is verbally abusing you or teammates, do not respond to their insults. Players that fall into this category will often sling degrading and racially derogatory terms in hopes of hurting the other players on an emotional level.
rap_1_nonevent_example				Player "1337honn3r" reports: "Offender told me "Your momma so fat when Devourer hooks her he gets pulled in" and he called me an idiot." This report was marked innocent because the offender did not verbally harass the player to the point of wanting to emotionally harm him.
